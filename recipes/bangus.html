        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Boneless bangus <em>scales removed, cleaned and butterflied</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic<em>crushed</em></li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorn</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine vinegar, garlic, whole peppercorn, and salt in a bowl. Stir.</li>
            <li>In a deep wide plate, pour-in the mixture and then lay down the fish in a manner that the sliced part is facing down (skin should face up). Cover and place in the fridge. Marinate for 8 to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan. Fry both sides of the bangus in medium heat until the color turns medium brown (note: it should take around 5 minutes per side). Note: the oil has a tendency to splatter because of the liquid from the marinade. Make sure to cover the pan while leaving open a small space for the steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Serve with spiced vinegar (sinamak)</li>
            <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
